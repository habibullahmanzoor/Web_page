Dr. Habib Ullah Manzoor is an AI Research Scientist and Ph.D. graduate in Applied Artificial Intelligence from the University of Glasgow, where his thesis titled Securing Intelligent Networks: Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Anomaly Detection was supported by a competitive global fellowship. With over 10 years of experience in academia and research, he specializes in machine learning, deep learning (CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers), federated and distributed learning, and cyber-secure AI systems. His technical expertise spans Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, LangChain, AWS (SageMaker, Bedrock, Lambda), and cybersecurity tools including SIEM, IDS, and IPS. Dr. Manzoor has led impactful projects such as a real-time mobile deepfake detection system for audio and video, an IoT- and AI-driven platform for deforestation monitoring using environmental sound analysis and cloud computing, and contributions to the SODOR project by building an autonomous weather station with ML-based anomaly detection for Scotlandâ€™s rail network. He also co-led a 10,000 GBP funded project on stealth attack detection in federated learning, achieving 90 percent detection accuracy through a novel game-theory-based aggregation framework. An experienced educator, he has taught and mentored students at the University of Glasgow and the University of Engineering and Technology Lahore, supervised over 20 research projects, and redesigned curricula around outcome-based education. His scholarly output includes many pree review journal articles, conference papers, and book chapters. He actively contributes to the research community as Guest Editor many journals, Technical Program Committee member for IEEE conferences, and peer reviewer for numerous high-impact journals, consistently advancing trustworthy, efficient, and socially impactful AI solutions
